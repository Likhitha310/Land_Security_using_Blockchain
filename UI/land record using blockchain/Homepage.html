          <h1>Digitization</h1>

          <div class="article_content">
              <h4><p></p>Digitization is the process of converting information into a digital format . In this format, information is organized into discrete units of data (called bits) that can be separately addressed (usually in multiple-bit groups called bytes). This is the binary data that computers and many devices with computing capacity (such as digital camera s and digital hearing aids) can process.</p>

          <p>Text and images can be digitized similarly: a scanner captures an image (which may be an image of text) and converts it to an image file, such as a bitmap . An optical character recognition ( OCR ) program analyzes a text image for light and dark areas in order to identify each alphabetic letter or numeric digit, and converts each character into an ASCII code.</p>

          <p>Audio and video digitization uses one of many analog-to-digital conversion processes in which a continuously variable ( analog ) signal is changed, without altering its essential content, into a multi-level (digital) signal. The process of sampling measures the amplitude (signal strength) of an analog waveform at evenly spaced time markers and represents the samples as numerical values for input as digital data.</p>

          <p>Digitizing information makes it easier to preserve, access, and share. For example, an original historical document may only be accessible to people who visit its physical location, but if the document content is digitized, it can be made available to people worldwide. There is a growing trend towards digitization of historically and culturally significant data.</p>

          <p>According to an article in The Guardian in March 2007, if all spoken language since the dawn of time were digitized, it would consume five exabyte s of storage space. Total digital information, in 2006 was estimated at 161 billion exabytes. Email alone made up six exabytes of that figure.</p>

            <h1>About</h1>
            <h4><p>Land is a limited resource and land administration is of great importance for all including individuals, industries, and government. Land administration is subject to national land policy and influences economic development and social stability. The land-related frauds are not novel to us. In India, the Land related processes are slow in some of the states. It is a long process involving multiple offices.</p>
              <p>In land administration, the most important task is to track ownership. To address the ownership tracking task, the present paper proposes a novel and secure process using Blockchain technology. </p>
              <p>With an important feature of immutability in blockchain, this technology can be effectively used in Land administration. With blockchain, every transaction is traceable, timestamped, and indisputable. These features can be used to provide a secure record of ownership data making it tamper-proof. In the present paper, the proposed system aims to use blockchain to provide security in the land digitization system, to reduce fraud and increase transparency.</p>
